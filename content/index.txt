h3. Lightning Talks

YOU will be doing lightning talks on whatever YOU want to show off.  Lightning talks are 5-10 minutes of YOU presenting with 5 minutes for people to ask YOU questions.  That means we'll have slots for 7 or 8 of YOU to talk.  So start thinking now about what YOU want present.  This meeting is all about YOU and the cool things YOU are doing.  Are YOU sensing a pattern here?

If YOU are not comfortable presenting, feel free to post ideas back to "the mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/dallasrb.  And if YOU can't think of anything, maybe YOU can take on one of the ideas posted.  There is no reason YOU should feel left out of this meeting :)

We'll see YOU there.
