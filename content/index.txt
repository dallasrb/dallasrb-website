h3.  InteGREAT - Integrations in Rails

Just about any application integrates with some sort of external service. Uploading files to AWS, liking all of your friends' statuses, or downloading tweets for the latest trending topic, a modern app is almost required to have an integration. While implementing a simple one may require nothing more than skimming through the README on the Github repo, more complicated integrations call for a deeper understanding of the process as a whole. Developers should be aware of best practices when dealing with complex integrations, such as syncing, volatile and persistent caching, and handling API limitations. This talk serves as a quick introduction to implementing integrations in a rails environment, beginning with a simple one-way integration and moving on to explore how to handle large amounts of data, the need for "real time" information, and working with API imposed limits.
