Dallas Ruby is the coolest place ever.  We meet the first Tuesday of every month.  Often there is hacking.  There is always food. Sometimes there is beer.

h3.  JRuby or JRuby not. There is no try.

* I'll show you how to install the latest JRuby with InvokeDynamic support.
* Threads are awesome. Don't worry, be happy. Libraries have threads. Your code doesn't.
* Continuous Testing: Starting up a JRuby process takes years. So testing with JRuby takes decades. Here's how to make it only take hours.
* Java sucks, but it's better than C.
* Logback: The last logging library you'll ever put on.
* Servlet API: Like Rack on NAWZ.
* Deployment: Maven, Bundler and JARs. Beets, Bears, Battlestar Galactica.
* JRuby vs Rubinius
* JRuby vs YARV

Bio:

Sam Smoot. Started developing professionally with ASP Classic. Moved onto ASP.NET and c#. Ended up at Ruby.
I've written O/RMs and Web Frameworks. I've created High Availability solutions and built out datacenter installations. I like BSD. I dislike dogma and hype; I prefer pro/con lists. My hobbies include drinking lagers and working on DIY projects around the house. I have an irresponsible amount of power tools considering I'm just a Programmer. You can stalk me on Twitter at @srsmoot.

h3. RubyNews

Karthik Hariharan will keep us up to date with the latest news for Ruby and Rails.

h3. Meeting Open to Everyone

We welcome everyone to the Dallas.rb meetings.  Come out and ask questions, help answer questions, or just be a part of the conversation.  There is always something new to learn!
