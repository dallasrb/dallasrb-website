h3. Models, Models, Every Where

Models form the backbone of our applications, but what are they and where to they come from? More importantly, do you have enough models or is your application missing some? Chris will show you how to spot missing models as well as create models with all of the goodies you've come to expect from Ruby on Rails. Along the way you'll be introduced to "ActiveAttr":https://github.com/cgriego/active_attr which makes it easy to construct models.

*About Chris Griego*

"Chris Griego":https://twitter.com/cgriego got started with Ruby through Ruby on Rails in 2005. Chris spends his days developing applications at "getaroom.com":http://www.getaroom.com/ and his evenings "contributing to open source projects":https://github.com/cgriego such as Mongoid and Capistrano.

h3. Ruby Basics Series: Web Services

Barrett Clark will be continuing the mini-series where we spend 20 minutes diving into a piece of basic Ruby tools and implementations. This month we'll look at consuming a web service and how to effectively test the implementation.


h3. Meeting Open to Everyone

We welcome everyone to the Dallas.rb meetings.  Come out and ask questions, help answer questions, or just be a part of the conversation.  There is always something new to learn!
