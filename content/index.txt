Dallas Ruby is the coolest place ever.  We meet the first Tuesday of every month.  Often there is hacking.  Sometimes there is beer.

h3. Share Your Ruby Knowledge

Being part of community is more than just sitting on the sidelines and watching everyone else have all the fun.  Come out this month and share one thing (or more) that you have been working on, playing with, or generally think is cool in Ruby.  It might be a code snippet or new gem you found. It can be Rails/Merb related (plugins/ apps/ secret cool shortcuts) if that is where you have been spending your days lately.  

General guidelines:
- Short topics (5 to 15 min, longer if needed)
- Formal slides are acceptable, but not required

Be sure to reply back to the group if you are planning on attending, even if you won't be presenting, so we can know how many people to expect.  

Feel free to post the topic(s) that you might talk about.  If you have something you would like to learn about, post it to the group, in case someone is looking for ideas.
