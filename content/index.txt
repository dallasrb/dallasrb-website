h3. Optimizing your Ruby on Rails Web Application

Has your Rails app become a bit pokey, now that you actually have users showing up to your site?  Do you miss the days when your app was quick witted, snappy, and the talk of the town?

Then come on down to August's Dallas Ruby Brigade meetup for a presentation on Optimizing your Ruby on Rails Web Application.  We'll look at server side performance, database query optimization, and client perceived load times.

After a brief presentation on a few of the tools available, we'll roll up our shirt sleeves and optimize some Real Live Code (sacrificial lambs generously provided by actual DRB members).

h3. Marshall Yount

Marshall ("@marshallyount":http://www.twitter.com/marshallyount) is a serial monogamist generalist programmer, having "gone steady" with a half dozen different languages and web platforms.  There are times when Ruby seems like she might be "the one," but he hasn't gotten the gumption to put a ring on that finger.  At "Yount Labs":http://yountlabs.com, Marshall enjoys video streaming, helping startups scale, and long walks on the beach.
