h3. Ruby Core and Standard Library Lookin

Barrett Clark will be continuing the mini-series where we spend 20 minutes diving into a piece of the Ruby Core or Standard library. This month we'll look at rake tasks, script inputs, and logging.

h3. Guarding your Projects

Guard is a command line tool that easily handles events on file modifications.  The primary use for guard is to automatically run tests based on changes to source files, but because of its modular nature, it can do much more.  We'll quickly cover typical setup and use, as well as alternative uses, and maybe even write our own guard gem for fun.

h3. The Best and Worst of 2011

We encourage you to bring a piece of code you have written this year that you are incredibly proud of (or something you are horribly ashamed of) and share it with the group. This is a great way for all of us to get a glimpse into what we are all working on. 

If you'd like to present, plan to spend 5 or 10 minutes talking about your code, the intention behind it, and why you love (or hate) it. *Prizes* will be given to the Best and the Worst code presented.


h3. Meeting Open to Everyone

We welcome everyone to the Dallas.rb meetings.  Come out and ask questions, help answer questions, or just be a part of the conversation.  There is always something new to learn!
