h3. Ruby, Rails, and Winning!

Step inside the world of using Ruby and Rails in the hotness that is Developer Contests. Through my recent experiences we'll explore:

* *Contest Logistics*: Where do I find these? How do you choose the "right sized" project?
* *Technical Lessons Learned*
* *After the Deadline*: Waiting, coping, celebrating
* *After the After*: What do I do with this thing now?

We'll actually spend the bulk of the time looking at different technical implementations, exploring projects that hook together several web services into offerings that are cool and hip.

h3. Mark McSpadden

Mark does Ruby and Rails and has for quite a while now. He has recently been on a contest kick and has faired pretty well. In May, his "Book Chirpa":http://www.bookchirpa.com won first prize in the O'Reilly/Fluidinfo Writable API contest. In July, his "Charity Chirpa":http://www.charitychirpa.com won the Wildcard category of the Donor's Choose Hacking Eduction contest. And in late July he won absolutely nothing for his entry into the Evernote Developer's Competition, "Elephant Tracks":http://www.elephanttracksapp.com. He also has a fairly unsuccessful record with the Google Code Jam in 2009, 2010, and 2011.
