h3. The Path to Ruby: A panel discussion

This month will feature four of our local Rubyists. Karthik Hariharan, Steve Crozier, Curtis Summers, and Greg Vaughn will take part in a panel discussion centered around how they came to and have progressed in software development and Ruby.

This is a great opportunity for people at all points in the Ruby path. Whether you're just getting started or have been at it for a while, we hope to see you there.


h3. Meeting Open to Everyone

We welcome everyone to the Dallas.rb meetings.  Come out and ask questions, help answer questions, or just be a part of the conversation.  There is always something new to learn!
