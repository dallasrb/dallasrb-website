h3. CSS Metaframeworks

Everything you wanted to know about CSS meta frameworks but were too scared to ask including:

* what the heck is a CSS meta framework?
* why should I care about CSS meta frameworks?
* who would win in a "Sass":http://sass-lang.com/ vs. "LessCSS":http://lesscss.org deathmatch?
* how do you go about using meta frameworks with Ruby projects?
* will I have to give up Dreamweaver?
* will I be left saying wow, "that's so meta!"?
* and more!
