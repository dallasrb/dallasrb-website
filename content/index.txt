h3.  Infrastructure as Code with Chef

The full stack: the final frontier. As developers we take problems and use code to describe the proposed solution to solve the problem using the resources available to us. Infrastructure as Code is a way of codifying the installation of services and software on a machine starting with a fresh image.
<br/><br/>
This session explores infrastructure as code using Chef and will allow you to manage your infrastructure as resources in code vs. a slew of shell scripts. In addition, talk about Chef testing techniques.
