h3. Tactical Design

I’ve noticed that when people try to improve the state of the art of software design, they try to think bigger: big patterns, big principles, discussions about classes and modules and components, layers and tiers. Last year I heard a talk called “Strategic Design”.

But I’ve personally had a lot better luck thinking small.

In this talk, we’ll explore just a few small-scale, tactical design principles, and how they can help you and your team build better systems.

h3. Glenn Vanderburg

Glenn Vanderburg works at Relevance, Inc., where he helps customers build great systems with Ruby. He has been working with Ruby since 2000, and thinking about good design for a lot longer than that. He lives in the Dallas area.
