h3. Lightning Talks

It's been a while since we've met, so bring something you've learned to share with the group. It can be anything from a gem you've tried, an upgrade experience (!!!), a new service or process you're experimenting with, or anything else under the Ruby sun.

h3. Best/Worst of 2012

Ah, 2012. We wrote some good code and we wrote some not so good code. Bring your best and worst Ruby from last year and we'll share them.

h3. RubyNews

We'll get up to date with the latest news for Ruby and Rails.

h3. Meeting Open to Everyone

We welcome everyone to the Dallas.rb meetings.  Come out and ask questions, help answer questions, or just be a part of the conversation.  There is always something new to learn!
