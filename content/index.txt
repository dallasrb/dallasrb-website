h3. Ruby Crush: A Metaprogramming Primer

Scott Johnson will guide us through metaprogramming techniques to demystify the magic in Rails (and other Ruby programs) and how to apply those techniques to improve your code.

We will cover Dynamic Dispatch, Ghost Methods, Class Macros and The Ruby Object Model, then apply those techniques to make something cool.
