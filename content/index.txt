h3. 2011 Meetup @ The Londoner

Since it is the beginning of the new year, it was decided that we should all get together to hangout, drink (or not), and talk Ruby and tech in a less formal setting.  If you have never been out to a Dallas.rb meeting, this is a great way to come get to know some of the local Rubyists.  We are open to anyone and everyone.
