h3. Exploring PostgreSQL

We'll cover Materialized Views (the basics of denormalization and indexing), LISTEN/NOTIFY (a simple, persistent, reliable queue), Replication (with Bucardo), Windowing Functions (pagination with only one query), functions in general purpose languages (perl), and discuss ways to manage your schema. We'll also cover basics like, "how much data can a database chuck if a database could chuck data", and ways to buy the performance you want on the cheap.

h3. Sam Smoot

I've been using Ruby since v1.80, close to 7 years. I've written and contributed to "DataMapper":http://datamapper.org/, "Harbor":http://wiecklabs.com/, "Sequel":http://sequel.rubyforge.org/, "Rails":http://rubyonrails.org/ as well as various small personal projects. Currently I'm the senior manager at "Wieck Media":http://www.wieck.com/, where we develop sites for Press and Syndication services for clients including Honda, NYTimes, MB-USA, etc. My latest love is shell programming with Bash, and dabbling in networking, virtualization, and enterprise level storage technologies.
