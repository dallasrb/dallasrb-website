h3. Building full-text search into your Rails application

We will be looking at different searching solutions using Ruby.   So far we have people presenting on Ferret, Sphinx and Xapien. If you've had experience with Solr or another full-text index, feel free to come and share them!

We will have time at the beginning of the meeting for you to share little things that you have found, worked on, or generally thought was cool in Ruby recently.
