An intro to using "Redis":http://code.google.com/p/redis/ and "Resque":http://github.com/defunkt/resque for all your background processing needs.

h4. How to turn Javascript into web serving awesome! - Kevin Marvin

A brief demonstration of using "NodeJS":http://nodejs.org/, "ExpressJS":http://expressjs.com/, "MongoDB":http://www.mongodb.org/ and "EJS":http://embeddedjs.com/ to make a web app that screams.  We will spend some time talking about:
* The difficulty in moving to a new, bleeding edge platform
* Using a framework that so closely resembles Sinatra it could be his evil twin
* What kinds of performance one can expect from Closure driven development
* Hacking Helpers - How to type less and include more

h3. Bios:

*Brian* is a developer. He likes code and lots of it. He also likes beer, and once again, lots of it. There's other stuff he likes too. He works on "memoryreel.com":http://memoryreel.com doing awesome things with apis

*Kevin* is a professional amateur.  Currently the CIO of MODx LLC - the company behind the "MODx PHP CMS/CMF":http://modxcms.com/, he's been a systems engineer, network architect, PHP coder, Ruby / Rails coder, and now thinks getting a bloody nose with the latest thing is more fun than anything.
