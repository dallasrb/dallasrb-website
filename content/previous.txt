h3. Robotic Rails

Description: File uploads and writing tests are fairly core to most Rails applications, but they’re also 2 of the things that cause developers the most headache. Taking a glimpse at the "thoughtbot Community Tools":http://thoughtbot.com/community/, you can discover simple approaches to tackle those feats with ease. "Paperclip":http://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip makes file storage easy and efficient by limiting how much code is needed, as well as reducing your database overhead from the bloat of multiple records per image (as seen with "attachment_fu":http://github.com/technoweenie/attachment_fu). "Shoulda":http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda consists of test macros, assertions, and helpers that make testing a breeze.  "Factory Girl":http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl provides a framework and DSL for defining and using factories  to create data records for ruby test suites. The goal is to be less error-prone,  more explicit, and all-around easier to work with than Rails’ fixtures.

h3. Just for Fun

Remember when you started using Ruby? That time when it was fun to tinker with things, write little amusing programs, explore new things. A time that you didn't worry about the quality of garbage collectors or what lambda syntax is the best. Back when coding was more fun and less serious?

Why not get back to those days? Sure, you can make a pretty good living writing Ruby for monies. But, your inner child, your inner artist, is waiting for you to come out and play, to come out and create.

See what fun other people are up to, discover the fun you might be missing out on, and learn how to have fun even when you do have to write production code for monies.

h3. Lightning Talks

YOU will be doing lightning talks on whatever YOU want to show off.  Lightning talks are 5-10 minutes of YOU presenting with 5 minutes for people to ask YOU questions.  That means we'll have slots for 7 or 8 of YOU to talk.  So start thinking now about what YOU want present.  This meeting is all about YOU and the cool things YOU are doing.  Are YOU sensing a pattern here?

If YOU are not comfortable presenting, feel free to post ideas back to "the mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/dallasrb.  And if YOU can't think of anything, maybe YOU can take on one of the ideas posted.  There is no reason YOU should feel left out of this meeting :)

We'll see YOU there.

h3. Titanium Platform for Desktop and Mobile Applications

The open-source "Titanium":http://www.appcelerator.com/ platform allows developers to use their existing knowledge of rich web application technologies – JavaScript, Python, Ruby, HTML and CSS – to build desktop and mobile applications. We'll see a brief overview of the things possible in Titanium, and get down and dirty with some Ruby libraries, to showcase the deep integration we have with the Ruby runtime.

h3. Software Craftsmanship, Mentorship, and Coding Mentors

Derek Lane and Mark McSpadden will "pair present" a look into this trending topic on the Software Development landscape. We will take a quick overview of the many different facets of Software Craftsmanship and spend a little time focused specifically on Mentorship.

We'll then explore a Rails project we've been working on called "Coding Mentors." We'll discuss the project, it's goals and vision, and some of the hurdles (technical, cultural, and personal) we've experienced thus far.

We think this will be a great opportunity for you to: 

* Get buzzword compliant in the realm of Software Craftsmanship
* Understand how Software Craftsmanship can improve your work
* Find out how to get started either mentoring or apprenticing in a specific discipline
* Learn from our mistakes/challenges in building a "simple" Rails app

Hope to see you there!

h3. Ruby on the Desktop(s)

You yawn when you read about static languages adding dynamic features and frameworks adding Rails-like functionality, but developing desktop applications in Ruby has peaked your interest. Real Ruby solutions are coming to both the Mac and the PC. We'll look at an application built with both MacRuby and IronRuby to show the state of Ruby on the desktop. We'll compare the platforms, the UI tools, and the pros and cons of using Ruby in these environments.

h3. Ruby Hacking. Again!

After the great response and turnout we will have another hands-on hack night at the Dallas.rb.  Come prepared to hack with everyone or just look over someone's shoulder.  You will have a chance to share on any code snippets, projects, or anything else you might have.  Don't have anything to share and just want to hack?  Come on and hang out with everyone else.  Got questions or need help with a project you are working on?  Come out and get some more eyes on it to help you out.

Be sure to RSVP so we will know how many to plan for.  The past few meetings, parking has been limited out front, but there is also a garage in the back easily accessible by driving around the south side of the building.  Park on the south side of garage (near vacant field) and come into the south building.

h3. Share Your Ruby Knowledge

Being part of community is more than just sitting on the sidelines and watching everyone else have all the fun.  Come out this month and share one thing (or more) that you have been working on, playing with, or generally think is cool in Ruby.  It might be a code snippet or new gem you found. It can be Rails/Merb related (plugins/ apps/ secret cool shortcuts) if that is where you have been spending your days lately.  

General guidelines:
- Short topics (5 to 15 min, longer if needed)
- Formal slides are acceptable, but not required

Be sure to reply back to the group if you are planning on attending, even if you won't be presenting, so we can know how many people to expect.  

Feel free to post the topic(s) that you might talk about.  If you have something you would like to learn about, post it to the group, in case someone is looking for ideas.

h2. January 6, 2009

h3. Smalltalk

h3. Tactical Design

I’ve noticed that when people try to improve the state of the art of software design, they try to think bigger: big patterns, big principles, discussions about classes and modules and components, layers and tiers. Last year I heard a talk called “Strategic Design”.

But I’ve personally had a lot better luck thinking small.

In this talk, we’ll explore just a few small-scale, tactical design principles, and how they can help you and your team build better systems.

h3. Glenn Vanderburg

Glenn Vanderburg works at "Relevance, Inc.":http://www.thinkrelevance.com, where he helps customers build great systems with Ruby. He has been working with Ruby since 2000, and thinking about good design for a lot longer than that. He lives in the Dallas area.

h2. August 5, 2008

h3. Hacks

The plan for tomorrow's meeting is to hack stuff, together. Here are some ideas:

* Hack on the Dallas.rb website. We're looking to rebuild it with Webby, a neat little static-site CMS written in Ruby. If you've got front-end skills, we could use a lot of help here.
* Hack on a Ruby Quiz. If you've got a favorite, let the list know and we can work on that one.
* Whatever project you may already have going.

If you just want to pair with someone else, that works too. I'll probably float around and try and work a little on the website and the quiz.

h2. July 1, 2008

h3. Oh the Fail I've Known

Some things sound like a great idea at the time. Hair bands. Crazy guys with a Casio keyboard. Even the Rails core thought components were a good idea for awhile there. Luckily, we later realize these things are not, in fact, all we thought they were cracked up to be.

Unfortunately, we usually learn these things after you’ve committed to them. Interacting with customers and teammates is hit or miss. Developers have to learn continuously but are left on their own to do so. The side-effects of using some API or feature aren’t often discussed in manuals. So it ends up we usually learn about these things by trying and failing.

Some kinds of experience are hard won. Join Adam Keys as he admits to the most embarrassing albums he owns. Adding to his humiliation, he’ll share the lessons he’s learned the hard way about building applications with Rails. His pain is your gain!

h3. Adam Keys

Adam is a software developer from Dallas, TX. He writes on his weblog, The Real Adam on topics ranging from Ruby to pizza. When not writing bios in the third person, Adam volunteers for dog rescue and as a feral cat caretaker. In general, Adam also likes to make those around him laugh. You’ve been warned.

h2. June 3, 2008

h3. Shoes

Jim Hughes will be sharing information using the Shoes framework.

h2. April 1, 2008

h3. Lightening Talks

We will be opening the floor to anyone who wants to share.  Have you had something you were working on, but didn't need a full meeting to talk about it?  Got a new project you want to show off?   Find some new Ruby code or library that you think others might find interesting?  This is your chance to share it.

Topics can range from 5 to 20 minutes.  Let me know if you have a topic that might go longer.

h2. Before This

There were others, but unfortunately we forgot the keep track of them.
