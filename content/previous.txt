h2. October 2, 2012

h3.  InteGREAT - Integrations in Rails

Just about any application integrates with some sort of external service. Uploading files to AWS, liking all of your friends' statuses, or downloading tweets for the latest trending topic, a modern app is almost required to have an integration. While implementing a simple one may require nothing more than skimming through the README on the Github repo, more complicated integrations call for a deeper understanding of the process as a whole. Developers should be aware of best practices when dealing with complex integrations, such as syncing, volatile and persistent caching, and handling API limitations. This talk serves as a quick introduction to implementing integrations in a rails environment, beginning with a simple one-way integration and moving on to explore how to handle large amounts of data, the need for "real time" information, and working with API imposed limits.

Speaker Bio:
Jorge Valdivia is a lead developer and technical architect at Software Allies.  He currently spends most of his time developing Rails apps, but has been known to hack away at anything the business requires, including Perl, C++, database development, mobile, and much more.

h2. September 4, 2012

h3.  Infrastructure as Code with Chef

The full stack: the final frontier. As developers we take problems and use code to describe the proposed solution to solve the problem using the resources available to us. Infrastructure as Code is a way of codifying the installation of services and software on a machine starting with a fresh image.
<br/><br/>
This session explores infrastructure as code using Chef and will allow you to manage your infrastructure as resources in code vs. a slew of shell scripts. In addition, talk about Chef testing techniques.

<br/><br/>
Jesse also blogs infrequently at "http://jessedearing.com":http://jessedearing.com.

h2. August 7, 2012

h3.  JRuby or JRuby not. There is no try.

* I'll show you how to install the latest JRuby with InvokeDynamic support.
* Threads are awesome. Don't worry, be happy. Libraries have threads. Your code doesn't.
* Continuous Testing: Starting up a JRuby process takes years. So testing with JRuby takes decades. Here's how to make it only take hours.
* Java sucks, but it's better than C.
* Logback: The last logging library you'll ever put on.
* Servlet API: Like Rack on NAWZ.
* Deployment: Maven, Bundler and JARs. Beets, Bears, Battlestar Galactica.
* JRuby vs Rubinius
* JRuby vs YARV

h3. Main Course: Ruby and Salesforce

Raymond Gao will provide an intro and overview into using Ruby with Salesforce. Salesforce is one of the leading CRM solution providers. Chatter (its social networking tool) is a really hot topic. Ruby on Salesforce integration is a relative new topic. I have the fortune of having written the Ruby Toolkit for Salesforce, used at 2010 DreamForce conference. Based on Ray's personal experience, this approach is probably one of the fastest ways to developing apps, running in the cloud (for example Heroku, Cloud Foundry, or Engine Yard, … ) while leveraging a pre-existing / widely accepted CRM data model. There is already a ~300 people developer community for this technology, around the world. 

h3. Main Course (Part 2): CloudSpokes: Cloud Architecture Case Study

Dave Messinger will join us virtually from Philadelphia and intro CloudSpokes. CloudSpokes is one of the hottest places to be right now for the cloud computing community. It lets users win top prizes (ranging $600 - $25,000) and skill badges, while it helps companies / organizations addressing their IT needs in a super lean fashion. Dave will share with us some of the behind the scenes of the sites technical aspects like storing data locally and in Salesforce, as well as how Ruby plays a role in their development strategy.

h2. September 6, 2011

h3. Ruby Newbie Q&A

Do you have Ruby questions that have been keeping you up at night?  What are mixins? Why can I find out what happened 4.weeks.ago in Rails?  Where should I deploy my next cool app?  Should I use MySQL or NoSQL? What is the github all the kids are talking about?  How can I get a full-time job programming Ruby and/or Rails everyday? Do I even want that?

With all the new faces that we have been seeing at the Dallas.rb in recent months, we want to take some time and give you a chance to ask those questions and many more.  Bring your questions and we will bring pizza, sodas, and answers.  Don't miss chance to get those questions answered.

Not a newbie? Come share your wisdom and experiences. You might even be surprised to learn a new thing or two yourself.

h3. Everyone

We welcome everyone to the Dallas.rb meetings.  Come out and ask questions, help answer questions, or just be a part of the conversation.  There is always something new to learn!

h2. August 2, 2011

h3. Ruby, Rails, and Winning!

Step inside the world of using Ruby and Rails in the hotness that is Developer Contests. Through my recent experiences we'll explore:

* *Contest Logistics*: Where do I find these? How do you choose the "right sized" project?
* *Technical Lessons Learned*
* *After the Deadline*: Waiting, coping, celebrating
* *After the After*: What do I do with this thing now?

We'll actually spend the bulk of the time looking at different technical implementations, exploring projects that hook together several web services into offerings that are cool and hip.

h3. Toystore, an Object Mapper for Key/Value Data Stores

From "Data Modeling in Performant Systems by John Nunemaker":http://railstips.org/blog/archives/2011/01/27/data-modeling-in-performant-systems/:

bq. Keeping an application performant is all about finding bottlenecks and fixing them. The problem is each bottleneck you fix leads to more usage and a new bottleneck. It is a constant game of cat and mouse. Sometimes you are the cat and sometimes, well, you are not.

bq. Most of the time, the removal of those bottlenecks is about moving hot data to places that can serve it faster. Disks are slow, memory is fast, enter more memcached.

bq. Over time, you work and work to move hot data into memory and simplify your data access to fit into memory. Key here, value there. Eventually, you get to a place where you have simplified how you access your data into simple key/value lookups.

At "Zynga With Friends":http://www.zyngawithfriends.com, we were looking for ways to leverage some of the new NoSQL technologies without giving up some of the ease of the ORM we had grown used to with ActiveRecord.  That is how "Toystore":https://github.com/newtoy/toystore was born.

We will take a look at "Adapter":https://github.com/newtoy/adapter, a common interface to key/value data stores.  After that we will see what "Toystore":https://github.com/newtoy/toystore can provide, the reasoning behind it, and the design decisions made along the way.

h3. Geoffrey Dagley

Geoffrey works for "Zynga with Friends (formally Newtoy)":http://www.zyngawithfriends.com, creators of "Words with Friends":http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/words-with-friends-free/id321916506?mt=8 and "Chess with Friends":http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chess-with-friends-free/id295436227?mt=8, where he is responsible for keeping the servers humming for the 2.5M+ daily users of the Games With Friends games.

h2. January 5, 2011

h3. 2011 Meetup @ The Londoner

Since it is the beginning of the new year, it was decided that we should all get together to hangout, drink (or not), and talk Ruby and tech in a less formal setting.  If you have never been out to a Dallas.rb meeting, this is a great way to come get to know some of the local Rubyists.  We are open to anyone and everyone.

h2. December 7, 2010

h3. 2010: A Year in Code

Show off your most shameful, as well as the most awesomest, line(s) of Ruby code you wrote in 2010. Be ready to explain your code, why you wrote it, etc. We will vote on our favorites....maybe even have prizes for the winner and the loser.

Create a "gist on Github":https://gist.github.com/ that way we won't have to mess with switching out laptops. We can use a browser and talk about the code.

h2. November 2, 2010

h3. Optimizing your Ruby on Rails Web Application

Has your Rails app become a bit pokey, now that you actually have users showing up to your site?  Do you miss the days when your app was quick witted, snappy, and the talk of the town?

Then come on down to August's Dallas Ruby Brigade meetup for a presentation on Optimizing your Ruby on Rails Web Application.  We'll look at server side performance, database query optimization, and client perceived load times.

After a brief presentation on a few of the tools available, we'll roll up our shirt sleeves and optimize some Real Live Code (sacrificial lambs generously provided by actual DRB members).

h3. Rails' Next Top Model: Using ActiveModel and ActiveRelation

Rails jumped on the scene five years ago in part due to excellent support for connecting database tables to Ruby classes via ActiveRecord. Rails 3 makes two major improvements to this support. ActiveModel makes it easy to turn any old object into one that looks like ActiveRecord to your Rails app. ActiveRelation makes many kinds of queries easier and makes it possible to write some queries that were very difficult in the past.

In this talk, we’ll learn how to build our own model layer using ActiveRelation and ActiveModel. We’ll start by learning how ARel works and how to use it. Then we’ll write an adapter for our own database. Next, we’ll see what ActiveModel provides and how we use it through ActiveRecord. With this in mind, we’ll add functionality to our models that make them look just like ActiveRecord to our Rails app.

In the end, we’ll have a good grasp on the new options for modeling data in Rails 3 and how we can use that to write cleaner apps.

h3. Robotic Rails

Description: File uploads and writing tests are fairly core to most Rails applications, but they’re also 2 of the things that cause developers the most headache. Taking a glimpse at the "thoughtbot Community Tools":http://thoughtbot.com/community/, you can discover simple approaches to tackle those feats with ease. "Paperclip":http://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip makes file storage easy and efficient by limiting how much code is needed, as well as reducing your database overhead from the bloat of multiple records per image (as seen with "attachment_fu":http://github.com/technoweenie/attachment_fu). "Shoulda":http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda consists of test macros, assertions, and helpers that make testing a breeze.  "Factory Girl":http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl provides a framework and DSL for defining and using factories  to create data records for ruby test suites. The goal is to be less error-prone,  more explicit, and all-around easier to work with than Rails’ fixtures.

h3. Just for Fun

Remember when you started using Ruby? That time when it was fun to tinker with things, write little amusing programs, explore new things. A time that you didn't worry about the quality of garbage collectors or what lambda syntax is the best. Back when coding was more fun and less serious?

Why not get back to those days? Sure, you can make a pretty good living writing Ruby for monies. But, your inner child, your inner artist, is waiting for you to come out and play, to come out and create.

See what fun other people are up to, discover the fun you might be missing out on, and learn how to have fun even when you do have to write production code for monies.

h3. Lightning Talks

YOU will be doing lightning talks on whatever YOU want to show off.  Lightning talks are 5-10 minutes of YOU presenting with 5 minutes for people to ask YOU questions.  That means we'll have slots for 7 or 8 of YOU to talk.  So start thinking now about what YOU want present.  This meeting is all about YOU and the cool things YOU are doing.  Are YOU sensing a pattern here?

If YOU are not comfortable presenting, feel free to post ideas back to "the mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/dallasrb.  And if YOU can't think of anything, maybe YOU can take on one of the ideas posted.  There is no reason YOU should feel left out of this meeting :)

We'll see YOU there.

h3. Software Craftsmanship, Mentorship, and Coding Mentors

Derek Lane and Mark McSpadden will "pair present" a look into this trending topic on the Software Development landscape. We will take a quick overview of the many different facets of Software Craftsmanship and spend a little time focused specifically on Mentorship.

We'll then explore a Rails project we've been working on called "Coding Mentors." We'll discuss the project, it's goals and vision, and some of the hurdles (technical, cultural, and personal) we've experienced thus far.

We think this will be a great opportunity for you to:

* Get buzzword compliant in the realm of Software Craftsmanship
* Understand how Software Craftsmanship can improve your work
* Find out how to get started either mentoring or apprenticing in a specific discipline
* Learn from our mistakes/challenges in building a "simple" Rails app

Hope to see you there!

h3. Ruby on the Desktop(s)

You yawn when you read about static languages adding dynamic features and frameworks adding Rails-like functionality, but developing desktop applications in Ruby has peaked your interest. Real Ruby solutions are coming to both the Mac and the PC. We'll look at an application built with both MacRuby and IronRuby to show the state of Ruby on the desktop. We'll compare the platforms, the UI tools, and the pros and cons of using Ruby in these environments.

h3. Ruby Hacking. Again!

After the great response and turnout we will have another hands-on hack night at the Dallas.rb.  Come prepared to hack with everyone or just look over someone's shoulder.  You will have a chance to share on any code snippets, projects, or anything else you might have.  Don't have anything to share and just want to hack?  Come on and hang out with everyone else.  Got questions or need help with a project you are working on?  Come out and get some more eyes on it to help you out.

Be sure to RSVP so we will know how many to plan for.  The past few meetings, parking has been limited out front, but there is also a garage in the back easily accessible by driving around the south side of the building.  Park on the south side of garage (near vacant field) and come into the south building.

h3. Share Your Ruby Knowledge

Being part of community is more than just sitting on the sidelines and watching everyone else have all the fun.  Come out this month and share one thing (or more) that you have been working on, playing with, or generally think is cool in Ruby.  It might be a code snippet or new gem you found. It can be Rails/Merb related (plugins/ apps/ secret cool shortcuts) if that is where you have been spending your days lately.

General guidelines:
- Short topics (5 to 15 min, longer if needed)
- Formal slides are acceptable, but not required

Be sure to reply back to the group if you are planning on attending, even if you won't be presenting, so we can know how many people to expect.

Feel free to post the topic(s) that you might talk about.  If you have something you would like to learn about, post it to the group, in case someone is looking for ideas.

h3. Tactical Design

I’ve noticed that when people try to improve the state of the art of software design, they try to think bigger: big patterns, big principles, discussions about classes and modules and components, layers and tiers. Last year I heard a talk called “Strategic Design”.

But I’ve personally had a lot better luck thinking small.

In this talk, we’ll explore just a few small-scale, tactical design principles, and how they can help you and your team build better systems.

h3. Glenn Vanderburg

Glenn Vanderburg works at "Relevance, Inc.":http://www.thinkrelevance.com, where he helps customers build great systems with Ruby. He has been working with Ruby since 2000, and thinking about good design for a lot longer than that. He lives in the Dallas area.

h3. Hacks

The plan for tomorrow's meeting is to hack stuff, together. Here are some ideas:

* Hack on the Dallas.rb website. We're looking to rebuild it with Webby, a neat little static-site CMS written in Ruby. If you've got front-end skills, we could use a lot of help here.
* Hack on a Ruby Quiz. If you've got a favorite, let the list know and we can work on that one.
* Whatever project you may already have going.

If you just want to pair with someone else, that works too. I'll probably float around and try and work a little on the website and the quiz.

h3. Oh the Fail I've Known

Some things sound like a great idea at the time. Hair bands. Crazy guys with a Casio keyboard. Even the Rails core thought components were a good idea for awhile there. Luckily, we later realize these things are not, in fact, all we thought they were cracked up to be.

Unfortunately, we usually learn these things after you’ve committed to them. Interacting with customers and teammates is hit or miss. Developers have to learn continuously but are left on their own to do so. The side-effects of using some API or feature aren’t often discussed in manuals. So it ends up we usually learn about these things by trying and failing.

Some kinds of experience are hard won. Join Adam Keys as he admits to the most embarrassing albums he owns. Adding to his humiliation, he’ll share the lessons he’s learned the hard way about building applications with Rails. His pain is your gain!

h3. Adam Keys

Adam is a software developer from Dallas, TX. He writes on his weblog, The Real Adam on topics ranging from Ruby to pizza.

h3. Lightening Talks

We will be opening the floor to anyone who wants to share.  Have you had something you were working on, but didn't need a full meeting to talk about it?  Got a new project you want to show off?   Find some new Ruby code or library that you think others might find interesting?  This is your chance to share it.

Topics can range from 5 to 20 minutes.  Let me know if you have a topic that might go longer.

h2. Before This

There were others, but unfortunately we forgot the keep track of them.
