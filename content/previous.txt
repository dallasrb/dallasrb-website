h3. 2010: A Year in Code

Show off your most shameful, as well as the most awesomest, line(s) of Ruby code you wrote in 2010. Be ready to explain your code, why you wrote it, etc. We will vote on our favorites....maybe even have prizes for the winner and the loser.

Create a "gist on Github":https://gist.github.com/ that way we won't have to mess with switching out laptops. We can use a browser and talk about the code.

h2. November 2, 2010

h3. Mobile Application Development

h4. Mobile Versions of Web Applications

John will talk about what he did to a desktop version of a "simple" CRM so that it renders nicely on the iPhone and the little tweaks to make it "easier" on the phone.

h4. Making Gowalla Go

Adam will talk about the databases and infrastructure that power Gowalla, how the application is deployed, and how developers work with designers to deliver a top-notch web and mobile experience.

h3. Speakers

h4. John Ivanoff

For "John Ivanoff":http://johnivanoff.blogspot.com, it all stared in 1981 with BASIC and hacking into the main frame to make his friend "absent" from school. In 1996 he found the WWW. Anyone remember Gopher?  Around 2003 I discovered web standards and in 2005 gave a "presentation on web standards":http://john-amy.com/css/presentation/s5-blank.html.

He is currently converting a Classic ASP web app to Rails.  You can find him on Twitter, "@john_ivanoff":http://twitter.com/john_ivanoff, and on github, "johnivanoff":http://github.com/johnivanoff.  And on April 30-May 1, he'll be ridding on the "SAM'S CLUB MS 150 Bike Ride":http://goo.gl/ZiUM. Can he count on your help?

h4. Adam Keys

h2. October 5, 2010

h3. Exploring PostgreSQL

We'll cover Materialized Views (the basics of denormalization and indexing), LISTEN/NOTIFY (a simple, persistent, reliable queue), Replication (with Bucardo), Windowing Functions (pagination with only one query), functions in general purpose languages (perl), and discuss ways to manage your schema. We'll also cover basics like, "how much data can a database chuck if a database could chuck data", and ways to buy the performance you want on the cheap.

h3. Sam Smoot

I've been using Ruby since v1.80, close to 7 years. I've written and contributed to "DataMapper":http://datamapper.org/, "Harbor":http://wiecklabs.com/, "Sequel":http://sequel.rubyforge.org/, "Rails":http://rubyonrails.org/ as well as various small personal projects.

h2. August 3, 2010

h3. Optimizing your Ruby on Rails Web Application

Has your Rails app become a bit pokey, now that you actually have users showing up to your site?  Do you miss the days when your app was quick witted, snappy, and the talk of the town?

Then come on down to August's Dallas Ruby Brigade meetup for a presentation on Optimizing your Ruby on Rails Web Application.  We'll look at server side performance, database query optimization, and client perceived load times.

After a brief presentation on a few of the tools available, we'll roll up our shirt sleeves and optimize some Real Live Code (sacrificial lambs generously provided by actual DRB members).

h3. Marshall Yount

Marshall ("@marshallyount":http://www.twitter.com/marshallyount) is a serial monogamist generalist programmer, having "gone steady" with a half dozen different languages and web platforms.  There are times when Ruby seems like she might be "the one," but he hasn't gotten the gumption to put a ring on that finger.  At "Yount Labs":http://yountlabs.com, Marshall enjoys video streaming, helping startups scale, and long walks on the beach.

h2. July 6, 2010

h3. Rails' Next Top Model: Using ActiveModel and ActiveRelation

Rails jumped on the scene five years ago in part due to excellent support for connecting database tables to Ruby classes via ActiveRecord. Rails 3 makes two major improvements to this support. ActiveModel makes it easy to turn any old object into one that looks like ActiveRecord to your Rails app. ActiveRelation makes many kinds of queries easier and makes it possible to write some queries that were very difficult in the past.

In this talk, we’ll learn how to build our own model layer using ActiveRelation and ActiveModel. We’ll start by learning how ARel works and how to use it. Then we’ll write an adapter for our own database. Next, we’ll see what ActiveModel provides and how we use it through ActiveRecord. With this in mind, we’ll add functionality to our models that make them look just like ActiveRecord to our Rails app.

In the end, we’ll have a good grasp on the new options for modeling data in Rails 3 and how we can use that to write cleaner apps.

h2. June 1, 2010

h3. Ruby at the Dallas Morning News

Learn how Ruby and Rails are influencing the world of journalism. Across the journalism world, Python/Django and Ruby/Rails are changing the way we tell stories to the public. Also, I'll discuss the way Ruby influences our everyday journalism needs with some real world examples.

h3. Ryan McNeill

Ryan McNeill is the computer-assisted reporting editor at The Dallas Morning News. That's a fancy way of saying he heads data analysis for both short- and long-term stories at The News. McNeill isn't a computer scientist, but a journalist who learned Perl and then Ruby as a way to wrangle odd data sets. Learning Rails is an effort to find new ways to tell stories. Other geeky things we use in the newsroom: SPSS, ArcGIS, UCINet, SQL Server and MySQL --- all in the name of finding stories others don't.

h2. April 6, 2010

h3. Microformats

"Microformats":http://microformats.org/: Most folks love 'em, hate 'em, or know nothing about them.  As a web deveoper, why should I care?  We'll take a look at some examples of microformats out in the wild, and evaluate a couple of ruby libraries, grounded in real world implementation experience on "IsItSafeToVisit":http://isitsafetovisit.com/.

h3. JRuby

h3. Kevin Marvin

h2. February 2, 2010

h3. CSS Metaframeworks

Everything you wanted to know about CSS meta frameworks but were too scared to ask including:

* what the heck is a CSS meta framework?
* why should I care about CSS meta frameworks?
* who would win in a "Sass":http://sass-lang.com/ vs. "LessCSS":http://lesscss.org deathmatch?
* how do you go about using meta frameworks with Ruby projects?
* will I have to give up Dreamweaver?
* will I be left saying wow, "that's so meta!"?
* and more!

h2. January 5, 2010

h3. Robotic Rails

Description: File uploads and writing tests are fairly core to most Rails applications, but they’re also 2 of the things that cause developers the most headache. Taking a glimpse at the "thoughtbot Community Tools":http://thoughtbot.com/community/, you can discover simple approaches to tackle those feats with ease. "Paperclip":http://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip makes file storage easy and efficient by limiting how much code is needed, as well as reducing your database overhead from the bloat of multiple records per image (as seen with "attachment_fu":http://github.com/technoweenie/attachment_fu). "Shoulda":http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda consists of test macros, assertions, and helpers that make testing a breeze.  "Factory Girl":http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl provides a framework and DSL for defining and using factories  to create data records for ruby test suites. The goal is to be less error-prone,  more explicit, and all-around easier to work with than Rails’ fixtures.

h3. Jen Wendling

Jen Wendling is a "software developer and graphic designer living in Dallas":http://jenwendling.com with her 2 adorable chinchillas. Aside from all things technical, she is an avid food enthusiast, loves to bowl and rocks the greens at TopGolf.

h2. December 1, 2009

h3. Just for Fun

Remember when you started using Ruby? That time when it was fun to tinker with things, write little amusing programs, explore new things. A time that you didn't worry about the quality of garbage collectors or what lambda syntax is the best. Back when coding was more fun and less serious?

Why not get back to those days? Sure, you can make a pretty good living writing Ruby for monies. But, your inner child, your inner artist, is waiting for you to come out and play, to come out and create.

See what fun other people are up to, discover the fun you might be missing out on, and learn how to have fun even when you do have to write production code for monies.

h3. Adam Keys

Adam Keys is a software developer, entertainer and lover of animals. He's written software in too many languages to name at startups, small businesses and Fortune 100 giants. His philosophy of coding is to write less code and have more fun writing it.

h2. November 3, 2009

h3. Ruby and Flex :: The Fastest Way To RIA

Ruby is one of the fastest (and most enjoyable) languages to program in for middle tier development. Flex is the fastest (and most enjoyable) front layer development framework. Evaluating AMF and using services provided by Ruby (specifically Ruby on Rails) we will see how Flex and Ruby is the fastest way to develop your enterprise level applications.

h2. October 6, 2009

h3. Lightning Talks

YOU will be doing lightning talks on whatever YOU want to show off.  Lightning talks are 5-10 minutes of YOU presenting with 5 minutes for people to ask YOU questions.  That means we'll have slots for 7 or 8 of YOU to talk.  So start thinking now about what YOU want present.  This meeting is all about YOU and the cool things YOU are doing.  Are YOU sensing a pattern here?

If YOU are not comfortable presenting, feel free to post ideas back to "the mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/dallasrb.  And if YOU can't think of anything, maybe YOU can take on one of the ideas posted.  There is no reason YOU should feel left out of this meeting :)

We'll see YOU there.

h2. September 1, 2009

h3. Titanium Platform for Desktop and Mobile Applications

The open-source "Titanium":http://www.appcelerator.com/ platform allows developers to use their existing knowledge of rich web application technologies – JavaScript, Python, Ruby, HTML and CSS – to build desktop and mobile applications. We'll see a brief overview of the things possible in Titanium, and get down and dirty with some Ruby libraries, to showcase the deep integration we have with the Ruby runtime.

h2. August 4, 2009

h3. Software Craftsmanship, Mentorship, and Coding Mentors

Derek Lane and Mark McSpadden will "pair present" a look into this trending topic on the Software Development landscape. We will take a quick overview of the many different facets of Software Craftsmanship and spend a little time focused specifically on Mentorship.

We'll then explore a Rails project we've been working on called "Coding Mentors." We'll discuss the project, it's goals and vision, and some of the hurdles (technical, cultural, and personal) we've experienced thus far.

We think this will be a great opportunity for you to:

* Get buzzword compliant in the realm of Software Craftsmanship
* Understand how Software Craftsmanship can improve your work
* Find out how to get started either mentoring or apprenticing in a specific discipline
* Learn from our mistakes/challenges in building a "simple" Rails app

Hope to see you there!

h3. Derek Lane

After years of fumbling around with the backyard grill, Derek Lane has recently found his life's calling as a BBQ Life Coach and a practitioner of all things BBQ. Oddly enough, he has also been known to ply both the art and science of Software Craftsmanship over the last couple of decades as well. Striving to find efficient and productive ways to build software has taken Lane on a journey where he has worn various hats including mentor, coach, architect, strategist, visionary, manager, developer, trainer, and methodologist, all while striving to apply the best technology for the job at hand. He is also a contributor to various projects as an author, presenter, committer, and technical reviewer.

Lane is a big believer in the value of volunteer based communities. This belief led him to start several technology based user groups including the Dallas/Fort Worth Texas MicroJava User Group, the Oklahoma City Java User Group (OKCJUG), and The Next Big JDK Thing User Group in Dallas, Texas. Lane has been active as a member, presenter, and mentor for over a decade at various technology user groups across the Midwest and Southern US.

Since starting on Rails (and Ruby) in 2005, he has benefited greatly from the help, guidance, and contributions of others in the industry. This camaraderie has led to a exploration into Software Craftsmanship and Mentorship and ways to improve these efforts within the Ruby community.

Mark works at <a href="http://www.thegarlandgroup.net">The Garland Group</a> on projects like <a href="http://www.banktastic.com">Banktastic</a> and <a href="http://www.riskkey.com">RiskKey</a> and keeps busy "after-hours" with side projects like <a href="http://www.firehosefilter.com/clouds/cu">The CU Filter</a> and the soon to be announced Coding Mentors.

h2. July 7. 2009

h3. Ruby on the Desktop(s)

You yawn when you read about static languages adding dynamic features and frameworks adding Rails-like functionality, but developing desktop applications in Ruby has peaked your interest. Real Ruby solutions are coming to both the Mac and the PC. We'll look at an application built with both MacRuby and IronRuby to show the state of Ruby on the desktop. We'll compare the platforms, the UI tools, and the pros and cons of using Ruby in these environments.

h3. Ruby Hacking. Again!

After the great response and turnout we will have another hands-on hack night at the Dallas.rb.  Come prepared to hack with everyone or just look over someone's shoulder.  You will have a chance to share on any code snippets, projects, or anything else you might have.  Don't have anything to share and just want to hack?  Come on and hang out with everyone else.  Got questions or need help with a project you are working on?  Come out and get some more eyes on it to help you out.

Be sure to RSVP so we will know how many to plan for.  The past few meetings, parking has been limited out front, but there is also a garage in the back easily accessible by driving around the south side of the building.  Park on the south side of garage (near vacant field) and come into the south building.

h2. February 3, 2009

h3. Share Your Ruby Knowledge

Being part of community is more than just sitting on the sidelines and watching everyone else have all the fun.  Come out this month and share one thing (or more) that you have been working on, playing with, or generally think is cool in Ruby.  It might be a code snippet or new gem you found. It can be Rails/Merb related (plugins/ apps/ secret cool shortcuts) if that is where you have been spending your days lately.

General guidelines:
- Short topics (5 to 15 min, longer if needed)
- Formal slides are acceptable, but not required

Be sure to reply back to the group if you are planning on attending, even if you won't be presenting, so we can know how many people to expect.

Feel free to post the topic(s) that you might talk about.  If you have something you would like to learn about, post it to the group, in case someone is looking for ideas.

h2. January 6, 2009

h3. Smalltalk

With all the comparisons made between Ruby and Smalltalk and the excitement over the MagLev Ruby VM you might be wanting to know more about Smalltalk. Come and learn more about Smalltalk from "James Robertson":http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView.

h2. November 11, 2008

h3. Building full-text search into your Rails application

We will be looking at different searching solutions using Ruby.   So far we have people presenting on Ferret, Sphinx and Xapien. If you've had experience with Solr or another full-text index, feel free to come and share them!

We will have time at the beginning of the meeting for you to share little things that you have found, worked on, or generally thought was cool in Ruby recently.

h2. October 7, 2008

h2. September 2, 2008

h3. Tactical Design

I’ve noticed that when people try to improve the state of the art of software design, they try to think bigger: big patterns, big principles, discussions about classes and modules and components, layers and tiers. Last year I heard a talk called “Strategic Design”.

But I’ve personally had a lot better luck thinking small.

In this talk, we’ll explore just a few small-scale, tactical design principles, and how they can help you and your team build better systems.

h3. Glenn Vanderburg

Glenn Vanderburg works at "Relevance, Inc.":http://www.thinkrelevance.com, where he helps customers build great systems with Ruby. He has been working with Ruby since 2000, and thinking about good design for a lot longer than that. He lives in the Dallas area.

h2. August 5, 2008

h3. Hacks

The plan for tomorrow's meeting is to hack stuff, together. Here are some ideas:

* Hack on the Dallas.rb website. We're looking to rebuild it with Webby, a neat little static-site CMS written in Ruby. If you've got front-end skills, we could use a lot of help here.
* Hack on a Ruby Quiz. If you've got a favorite, let the list know and we can work on that one.
* Whatever project you may already have going.

If you just want to pair with someone else, that works too. I'll probably float around and try and work a little on the website and the quiz.

h2. July 1, 2008

h3. Oh the Fail I've Known

Some things sound like a great idea at the time. Hair bands. Crazy guys with a Casio keyboard. Even the Rails core thought components were a good idea for awhile there. Luckily, we later realize these things are not, in fact, all we thought they were cracked up to be.

Unfortunately, we usually learn these things after you’ve committed to them. Interacting with customers and teammates is hit or miss. Developers have to learn continuously but are left on their own to do so. The side-effects of using some API or feature aren’t often discussed in manuals. So it ends up we usually learn about these things by trying and failing.

Some kinds of experience are hard won. Join Adam Keys as he admits to the most embarrassing albums he owns. Adding to his humiliation, he’ll share the lessons he’s learned the hard way about building applications with Rails. His pain is your gain!

h3. Adam Keys

Adam is a software developer from Dallas, TX. He writes on his weblog, The Real Adam on topics ranging from Ruby to pizza. When not writing bios in the third person, Adam volunteers for dog rescue and as a feral cat caretaker. In general, Adam also likes to make those around him laugh. You’ve been warned.

h2. June 3, 2008

h3. Shoes

Jim Hughes will be sharing information using the Shoes framework.

h2. April 1, 2008

h3. Lightening Talks

We will be opening the floor to anyone who wants to share.  Have you had something you were working on, but didn't need a full meeting to talk about it?  Got a new project you want to show off?   Find some new Ruby code or library that you think others might find interesting?  This is your chance to share it.

Topics can range from 5 to 20 minutes.  Let me know if you have a topic that might go longer.

h2. Before This

There were others, but unfortunately we forgot the keep track of them.

Back to "Home":/
